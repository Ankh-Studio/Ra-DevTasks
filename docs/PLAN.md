# Project Plan: CodeChef Additional Tools Planning

## Overview
- **Objective**: Transform the brainstormed tool ideas into actionable implementation plans and establish project planning artifacts.
- **Success Criteria**: Each idea in `plans/IDEAS.md` has a corresponding detailed task file. `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, and `docs/IDEAS.md` are committed to the repository.
- **Timeline**: 1 day for documentation and planning.
- **Priority**: High

## Technical Analysis
- **Current State**: Repository contains high-level idea list without structured implementation guidance or planning documents.
- **Proposed Solution**: Create centralized planning documents and generate detailed task files for each proposed tool.
- **Technology Stack**: Markdown for documentation; future implementations will involve Angular frontend, Node/Express backend, and supporting libraries per tool.
- **Dependencies**: External libraries such as `graphql-codegen`, `openapi-typescript-codegen`, `cron-parser`, `jsonwebtoken`, `js-yaml`, `sharp`, AWS SDK, etc.

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Establish planning documents (`docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/IDEAS.md`).
- **Phase 2**: Generate detailed implementation plans for all 31 tool ideas.
- **Phase 3**: (Future) Execute development per task files with testing and security hardening.
- **Phase 4**: (Future) Deploy tools and integrate monitoring/observability.

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Inconsistent task granularity, overlooking security/performance considerations.
- **Business Risks**: Scope creep from large number of tools, potential resource constraints.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Standardized task template, prioritize high-value tools, iterative development with feedback.

## Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: Enforce peer review with checklist for security, performance, and style.
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage and comprehensive integration tests for each tool.
- **Security**: Perform dependency scanning, input validation, and secret management.
- **Performance**: Benchmarks and runtime monitoring for backend services.

## Status: Complete
