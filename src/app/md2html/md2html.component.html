            <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the foundational language for structuring content on
                the web. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements on a webpage, such as headings,
                paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML provides structure and semantics, allowing browsers to
                interpret and render the content appropriately. For example, using <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for headers
                and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for paragraphs helps search engines and assistive technologies understand the
                content’s hierarchy. HTML is versatile, highly customizable, and well-suited for complex layouts,
                multimedia, and web application interactivity, making it essential for building modern websites and
                applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Markdown</strong>, on the other hand, is a lightweight markup language designed for readability
                and ease of use. With its simple syntax, Markdown is ideal for writing content in plain text that can be
                easily converted to formatted HTML or other formats. It was initially created for web writers who wanted
                a quick, accessible way to structure content without needing to remember extensive HTML syntax.
                Markdown&#39;s syntax includes elements like <code>#</code> for headings, <code>*</code> for lists, and
                <code>**</code> for bold text, making it intuitive and fast for creating readable, structured content.
                Its popularity has grown widely, especially in documentation, blogging, and collaborative platforms like
                GitHub, where simplicity and clarity are key.</p>
            <p><strong>Conversion between HTML and Markdown</strong> is common because each serves distinct purposes in
                different contexts. Converting Markdown to HTML is a straightforward way to take plain text content and
                render it for the web, making it possible to publish articles, documentation, or blog posts without
                complex coding. Conversely, converting HTML to Markdown can be helpful when transferring web content to
                environments where Markdown is preferred, such as in GitHub repositories, certain content management
                systems, or collaboration tools. The conversion process allows writers and developers to leverage
                Markdown’s simplicity for writing and editing while utilizing HTML’s formatting flexibility for web
                display. </p>
